# Stress Level Analysis & Prediction

This project explores how lifestyle and behavioral factors influence stress levels and applies machine learning models to predict stress categories.

## Objectives
- Analyze key factors affecting stress levels
- Build and compare machine learning models for stress prediction
- Interpret results to extract meaningful insights

## Dataset
The dataset includes lifestyle and health-related features such as sleep quality, physical activity, and heart rate indicators.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN )
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Key Insights
- Sleep quality and physical activity show a strong relationship with stress levels.
- Machine learning models effectively classify stress categories based on lifestyle patterns.

## Future Improvements
- Add model explainability (feature importance)
- Experiment with additional classifiers
- Deploy the model as a simple web application
